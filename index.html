          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)" target="_blank">Prince Rogers Nelson</a> was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on June 7, 1958,
        the son of jazz singer Mattie Della (née Shaw) and pianist and songwriter John Lewis Nelson. All four of his grandparents were from Louisiana. The jazz
        drummer Louis Hayes was his paternal cousin. He was named after his father's best known stage name, Prince Rogers, which his father used while 
        performing with Prince's mother in a jazz group called the Prince Rogers Trio.</p>

        <h3>Memorable Performances*</h3>
          <p>My first live Prince concert experience was the <strong>"1999 Tour"</strong> (Houston, TX). It also featured both Vanity 6 and the Time.
        The night is still a fresh memory!!! However, who could forget when Prince came on stage at George Harrison's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction
        in 2004 to perform Harrison's Beatles classic <em><strong>"While My Guitar Gently Weeps"</strong></em>? He was with an All-star cast of musicians that included 
        Tom Petty, Jeff Lynn, Steve Winwood and George's son Dhani Harrison and completely stole the show.</p>
